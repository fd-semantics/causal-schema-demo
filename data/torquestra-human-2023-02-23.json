        "text": "\nFormer savings and loan chief, Charles Keating, is facing more legal troubles in California. A federal appeals court has reinstated his state convictions for securities fraud. NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco.\nIn nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and loan. The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators. Keating's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality. And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole. Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before. That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely to send Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal. Elaine Corey, NPR news, San Francisco.\n\n",

        "text": "\nIraq's Saddam Hussein, facing U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi border, today sought peace on another front by promising to withdraw from Iranian territory and release soldiers captured during the Iran-Iraq war. Also today, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Washington seeking to mediate the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush on Tuesday said the United States may extend its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut off Iraq's last unhindered trade route. In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said today it had sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also said Soviet women, children and invalids would be allowed to leave Iraq. President Bush today denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of war,'' and said the United States is ``striking a blow for the principle that might does not make right.'' In a speech delivered at the Pentagon, Bush seemed to suggest that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time. ``No one should doubt our staying power or determination,'' he said.\n",

        "text": "US President George W. Bush warned against expectations he will lay out plans for \"a graceful exit\" from Iraq, as news reports Friday said the independent commission looking into Iraq policy will call for a 2008 withdrawal of US combat troops.\nThe White House has ordered a government-wide reassessment of US policy in Iraq amid soaring sectarian violence, fears of all-out civil war, and mounting domestic pressure to bring US troops home after opposition Democrats took control of the US Congress in the November 7 elections.\nHigh hopes for designing an exit strategy are being placed on a bipartisan commission created by the US Congress known as the Iraq Study Group, a 10-member panel of Washington notables co-chaired by former US secretary of state James Baker.\nThe panel's advice is a major chance for the president to overhaul his Iraq policy, even though the recommendations are nonbinding.\nThe panel -- which also includes former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former top Clinton aide Leon Panetta, and until recently defense secretary nominee Robert Gates -- have written a report to be delivered to the president on December 6. Details however have been leaking to the press for days.\n",

        "text": "Whether Polly Peck's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around. Sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an \"original equipment maker\" basis for sale under other companies' brand names.\nHe said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design the new products, and will move Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.\n\"Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected,\" Mr. Nadir said.\nAnd while Polly Peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.\n",

        "text": "\nGeneral Motors Corp. wants to buy as much as 15% of Jaguar PLC, marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against Ford Motor Co. for control of the British car maker.\nGM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $15 million worth of Jaguar shares but doesn't own any yet, according to GM officials here and at the company's Detroit headquarters. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote Jaguar that it intends \"to go to that 15%\" level once it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond $15 million, a Jaguar spokesman said yesterday.\nThe GM move follows Tuesday's declaration by Ford, which holds an unwelcome 12.45% stake in Jaguar, that it is prepared to bid for the entire company. GM is close to completing a friendly deal with Jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30% stake and joint manufacturing ventures. Speculative investors, betting on an imminent clash between Ford and GM, pushed up Jaguar's share price five pence (eight U.S. cents) to a near-record 720 pence ($11.60) in late trading on London's stock exchange yesterday. Since Tuesday, the shares have gained nearly 4%.\n",

        "text": "The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 6:\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez has made the right decision to travel to the United States on Thursday to affirm his desire to be reunited with his son, Elian. His presence on American soil is necessary to dispel doubts about his fitness as a father _ raised maliciously by Elian's Miami relatives _ and to end speculation that he is indifferent about reclaiming custody of his son. With Gonzalez all but out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to distort the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated claims that Elian is afraid to see his father.\nThe relatives are obviously fond of Elian, though their judgment has clearly been clouded by their animosity toward Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. Once Gonzalez comes to the United States _ it would be preferable if he went to Miami rather than to Washington _ only the most obdurate foes of Castro can argue that Elian should not be reunited with him. Gonzalez's arrival should also help clear the way for the Justice Department to make arrangements to transfer custody of the child.\n",

        "text": "Four children were injured when a suspected Moslem rebel lobbed a grenade at their home in a town north of here, the Philippine military said Wednesday.\nThe four children, aged three, six, seven and 17, suffered shrapnel wounds in the bodies after an unidentified man aboard a motorcycle threw the grenade at their home in the town of Sirawai late Tuesday, the military report said.\nIntelligence sources said the attack was a retaliatory move by rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) who had suffered heavy casualties in last week's fighting between their troops and the military in Sirawai.\n\"This could be the start of their retaliatory attacks,\" said a military official who asked not to be named.\nLast week's clashes, which left 30 rebels and four soldiers dead, came amid an impasse in ceasefire talks between the two sides, which failed to agree on the disposition of its forces around a rebel camp in the town of Buldon east of here.\n",

        "text": "The FBI has interviewed and released one of two men who were sought last week for questioning in connection with the sniper slaying of a doctor in the Buffalo, N.Y., area who performed abortions.\nThe two men, Ronald Stauber and Michael Gingrich, were named Thursday in a bulletin sent by the FBI office in Cleveland to police departments across the country. The men were not termed suspects, and FBI officials on Saturday played down the likelihood that either was involved in the Oct. 23 killing of the doctor, Barnett Slepian.\n``We are doing dozens if not hundreds of interviews a day,'' said Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo. ``I know of no information that would treat these two differently or would put them in any other category from the hundreds of leads we're investigating on a daily basis.''\n",

His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.\nThe Clinton administration has pushed for the boy's return to his father, ruling only he can speak for his son on immigration matters.

        "text": "HAVANA (AP) --\n\nWhile state-run television broadcast footage of Cuban exiles protesting in Miami against the repatriation of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban government urged its people to keep up their own demonstrations to ensure the boy's return.\nThe unusual airing of protests against President Fidel Castro appeared aimed at warning Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still force the reversal of the U.S. government's decision to return Gonzalez to Cuba.\nCastro attended a rally Thursday by media workers at Havana's Palace of Conventions to demand Gonzalez's return. For weeks the communist government has held such rallies almost daily.\n``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40 years of the blockade, armed invasions, sabotage and attempts to kill President Fidel Castro were for earlier generations,'' said Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written several books about Cuban emigration to the United States.\n",

        "text": "The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.\nThe Justice Department has emphasized that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly. According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.\nStill, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees. They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.\n\n",

Slepian was one of only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion groups had become routine over the past decade. He persevered through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose whether to bear a child.\nBut a principled commitment to provide a constitutionally protected service could not stop the assassin's bullet that tore through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night.

        "text": "Iran's parliament on Wednesday approved a bill obliging the government to \"revise its cooperation\" with the UN nuclear watchdog in retaliation for Security Council sanctions imposed on Tehran.\nThe text of the bill, which also tells the government to \"accelerate\" Iran's controversial nuclear programme, was approved by an overwhelming majority in the conservative-controlled parliament, with 161 in favour and 15 against.\nThe move is set to further inflame tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the Islamic republic has vowed to expand in defiance of the sanctions agreed by the UN Security Council last week.\nIran has refused to heed the council's demand to suspend uranium enrichment, a process that Western countries fear could be used to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful.\n",

The other concern wasn't identified.\nRatners's chairman, Gerald Ratner, said the deal remains of \"substantial benefit to Ratners.\" In London at mid-afternoon yesterday, Ratners's shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64).\nThe sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50% of Weisfield's shareholders, and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10.\nThe acquisition of 87-store Weisfield's raises Ratners's U.S. presence to 450 stores. About 30% of Ratners's profit already is derived from the U.S.\n\n",

        "text": "Iran's parliament on Wednesday approved a bill obliging the government to \"revise its cooperation\" with the UN nuclear watchdog in retaliation for Security Council sanctions imposed on Tehran.\nThe text of the bill, which also tells the government to \"accelerate\" Iran's controversial nuclear programme, was approved by an overwhelming majority in the conservative-controlled parliament, with 161 in favour and 15 against.\nThe move is set to further inflame tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the Islamic republic has vowed to expand in defiance of the sanctions agreed by the UN Security Council last week.\nIran has refused to heed the council's demand to suspend uranium enrichment, a process that Western countries fear could be used to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful.\n",

        "text": "The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.\nThe Justice Department has emphasized that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly. According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.\nStill, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees. They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.\n\n",
